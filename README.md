# D3 with React charts for 100DaysOfCode 
- Over the course of 3 months I completed a number of visualisation projects to teach myself D3.js with React.js 
- This codebase is a collection of the stand-alone bits of the challenge. Each of them took me between 1 and 3 days to complete. 
- Feel free to look at the code to get a feel for how I combined the two frameworks - D3 and React - but please bear in mind that since I was learning as I was going along, not all of the code will be necessary (rather, I might have kept it in for my future reference), or very nice/readable.
